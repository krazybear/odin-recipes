    <h2>Description:</h2>

<p>This is the classic lasagne alla Bolognese recipe from the Emilia region in Northern Italy. </p>
<p>The Bolognese sauce is made with a mixture of beef and pork mince.</p>
<p>The addition of prosciutto, red wine, cinnamon, and nutmeg make it truly authentic.</p>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<h3>Bolognese Sauce:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 carrot, chopped</li>
    <li>1 shallot, minced</li>
    <li>3 and a half prosciutto, chopped</li>
    <li>11 ounces ground pork</li>
    <li>11 ounces ground beef</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>half teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>6 fluid ounces red wine</li>
    <li>21 ounces peeled San Marzano tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
<h3>White Sauce:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>two thirds cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3 quarters cup milk</li>
    <li>half of a teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>



</ul>
<h3>Lasagna Layers</h3>
<ul>
    <li>11 ounces lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>2 ½ cups grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste </li>




</ul>

<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion, carrot, shallot, and prosciutto until onion is translucent and prosciutto releases some fat, about 10 minutes. Add pork and beef; season with 1 teaspoon nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt to taste. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Pour red wine over meat mixture; increase heat and cook until wine evaporates, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and mix well; bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes break down and flavors of Bolognese sauce have combined, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
    </li>
    <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat; add flour. Whisk vigorously until mixture is smooth. Pour in milk and cook, stirring occasionally, over medium heat until white sauce thickens enough to cover the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes; season with 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
    </li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and run under cold water to stop the cooking process. Lay noodles on a clean towel and pat dry.
    </li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
    </li>
    <li>Pour a ladleful of Bolognese sauce and a ladleful of white sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with 3 or 4 lasagna noodles. Cover noodles with 1/3 of the white sauce and 1/3 of the Bolognese sauce. Sprinkle some of the Parmesan cheese on top; cover with lasagna noodles. Repeat layers, ending with white sauce and Parmesan cheese.
    </li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and top is golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Let stand 3 to 4 minutes before slicing.
    </li>
